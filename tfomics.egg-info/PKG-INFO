        # Code standards
        
        Below is a wish list for code standards, at current no CI exists and so none of this is strongly enforced.
        
        - Linting with pylint is enforced on all merges to master.
        - We use pytest for unit tests and enforce 100% code coverage
        - Code should be formatted with autopep8
        
        ## Unit tests
        
        Unit tests can be found in [the test folder](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/oalmelid/tfomics/tree/master/tests).
        
        We use pytest for testing and pytest-cov for code coverage.
